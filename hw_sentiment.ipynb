    "\r\n",
    "This homework and associated bakeoff are devoted to supervised sentiment analysis using the ternary (positive/negative/neutral) version of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-3) as well as a new dev/test dataset drawn from restaurant reviews. Our goal in introducing the new dataset is to push you to create a system that performs well in both the movie and restaurant domains.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The homework questions ask you to implement some baseline system, and the bakeoff challenge is to define a system that does well at both the SST-3 test set and the new restaurant test set. Both are ternary tasks, and our central bakeoff score is the mean of the macro-FI scores for the two datasets. This assigns equal weight to all classes and datasets regardless of size.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The SST-3 test set will be used for the bakeoff evaluation. This dataset is already publicly distributed, so we are counting on people not to cheat by developing their models on the test set. You must do all your development without using the test set at all, and then evaluate exactly once on the test set and turn in the results, with no further system tuning or additional runs. __Much of the scientific integrity of our field depends on people adhering to this honor code__. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "One of our goals for this homework and bakeoff is to encourage you to engage in __the basic development cycle for supervised models__, in which you\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Design a new system. We recommend starting with something simple.\r\n",
    "1. Use `sst.experiment` to evaluate your system, using random train/test splits initially.\r\n",
    "1. If you have time, compare your system with others using `sst.compare_models` or `utils.mcnemar`. (For discussion, see [this notebook section](sst_02_hand_built_features.ipynb#Statistical-comparison-of-classifier-models).)\r\n",
    "1. Return to step 1, or stop the cycle and conduct a more rigorous evaluation with hyperparameter tuning and assessment on the `dev` set.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "[Error analysis](#Error-analysis) is one of the most important methods for steadily improving a system, as it facilitates a kind of human-powered hill-climbing on your ultimate objective. Often, it takes a careful human analyst just a few examples to spot a major pattern that can lead to a beneficial change to the feature representations."

    "You don't have to use the experimental framework defined below (based on `sst`). The only constraint we need to place on your system is that it must have a `predict_one` method that can map directly from an example text to a prediction, and it must be able to make predictions without having any information beyond the text. (For example, it can't depend on knowing which task the text comes from.) See [the bakeoff section below](#Bakeoff-[1-point]) for examples of functions that conform to this specification."

    "Your task is to develop an original model for the SST-3 problem and our new bakeoff dataset. There are many options. If you spend more than a few hours on this homework problem, you should consider letting it grow into your final project! Here are some relatively manageable ideas that you might try:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. We didn't systematically evaluate the `bidirectional` option to the `TorchRNNClassifier`. Similarly, that model could be tweaked to allow multiple LSTM layers (at present there is only one), and you could try adding layers to the classifier portion of the model as well.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. We've already glimpsed the power of rich initial word representations, and later in the course we'll see that smart initialization usually leads to a performance gain in NLP, so you could perhaps achieve a winning entry with a simple model that starts in a great place.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Our [practical introduction to contextual word representations](finetuning.ipynb) covers pretrained representations and interfaces that are likely to boost the performance of any system.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We want to emphasize that this needs to be an __original__ system. It doesn't suffice to download code from the Web, retrain, and submit. You can build on others' code, but you have to do something new and meaningful with it. See the course website for additional guidance on how original systems will be evaluated.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the cell below, please provide a brief technical description of your original system, so that the teaching team can gain an understanding of what it does. This will help us to understand your code and analyze all the submissions to identify patterns and strategies.  We also ask that you report the best score your system got during development (your best average of macro-F1 scores), just to help us understand how systems performed overall."
